# craft-bitstream

L0 bitstream foundation: re-exports `craft_media::bitstream` and owns the allocation-free
`BoolDecoder` used by both VP8 and VP9. No unsafe code or codec dependencies.

## Boolean decoder (#131)

Implemented from RFC 6386 section 7 (VP8) and the *VP9 Bitstream & Decoding Process
Specification*, v0.6, 31 March 2016, sections 9.2–9.3. No third-party codec source was used.
The 64-bit value window refills seven or eight bytes at a time with safe slice access;
symbol decoding uses masked range selection and leading-zero-count normalisation, with
no input indexing outside refill. Probability adaptation remains in each codec.

- `new` starts a VP8 partition, preserving zero extension beyond its end.
- `new_vp9` rejects empty partitions and nonzero marker bits.
- `finish_vp9` checks actual consumption rather than prefetched bytes and rejects overreads;
  nonzero remaining padding is recorded by `had_nonzero_padding` for the caller to report.
- Literals, equiprobable flags, signed fields and tree/subtree reads share the same state.
  Literal and signed widths are capped to their return types. Malformed trees have bounded
  traversal, return zero and record an error reported by `finish_vp9`.

Tests exhaust every initial byte and probability (including 0 and 255), compare a million
random symbols per codec with a bit-at-a-time reference, sweep all truncations through
1024 bytes, and cover literals, trees, signed fields, markers, padding and long overreads.
The RFC-style VP8 test encoder also round-trips all probabilities against this decoder.

Run `cargo test -p craft-bitstream`. VP8/VP9 codec-specific fixtures and benchmarks
remain in FilmCraft; the shared bitstream crate does not include codec tests.

## Provenance

Copied from FilmCraft `crates/bitstream` at commit
`409f54181386fec8cce62ce16a9a200511c29760` (`algo/131-bool-decoder`).
The boolean decoder was implemented from RFC 6386 §7 and the VP9 Bitstream & Decoding
Process Specification v0.6 §§9.2–9.3, not from third-party codec source. The
`craft_media::bitstream` reader/writer is re-exported from the existing shared crate.
Only workspace metadata and crate naming were adapted here.
